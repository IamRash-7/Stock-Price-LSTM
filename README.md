# Stock-Price-LSTM

This project predicts stock prices using LSTM.
LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) uses sequential data to predict the output. In this project, previous 100 days closing stock price is provided as input to produce the 101st day's prediction by the model.

I have also made a 30 day prediction into the future. Only time will tell its reliability ;)
